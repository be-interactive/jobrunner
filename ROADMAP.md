# PHP Package Roadmap

## Overview
This Package helps run your Laravel jobs in a more controlled and efficient way. 
It can read your scheduled jobs and (if you use the includes config-file) all other commands (with a signature).

## Future Enhancements
- Get job runtime statistics and output.
- Get job status (running, finished, failed).
- Log job output to a file.

## Additional Notes
- This package is still in development.
